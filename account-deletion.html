    <h1>Account and Data Deletion Request</h1>
    <p>
        This page provides information on how to request the deletion of your <span class="app-name">RoamBuddy</span> account and associated personal data. <span class="app-name">RoamBuddy</span> is a service provided by Reas Studio.
    </p>

    <h2>Deleting Your Account Within the App:</h2>
    <p>
        The easiest and recommended way to delete your account is through the <span class="app-name">RoamBuddy</span> application itself:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the <span class="app-name">RoamBuddy</span> app on your device.</li>
        <li>Navigate to your "Account Settings" or "Profile" section.</li>
        <li>Look for an option such as "Delete My Account" or "Request Account Deletion".</li>
        <li>Follow the on-screen prompts to confirm the deletion.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Please be aware that this action is permanent and will result in the deletion of your account and all associated personal data from our active databases. This process cannot be undone.
    </p>

    <h2>Requesting Deletion via Email:</h2>
    <p>
        If you are unable to delete your account through the app, or if you prefer, you can request account deletion by sending an email from the email address associated with your <span class="app-name">RoamBuddy</span> account to:
        <br>
        <span class="contact-email">studioreas@mail.com</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        In your email, please state clearly that you wish to delete your <span class="app-name">RoamBuddy</span> account.
    </p>
    <p>
        Upon receiving your request, we may need to ask for additional information to verify your identity before proceeding with the deletion. We aim to process deletion requests promptly.
    </p>

    <h2>Important Considerations:</h2>
    <p>
        Please note that deleting your account will remove your personal information as described. However, some data may be retained if legally required or for legitimate business purposes, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Transaction records for financial reporting (if applicable to your use of the service).</li>
        <li>Anonymized or aggregated data used for analytics and service improvement, which does not personally identify you.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We are committed to protecting your privacy. For more details on how we handle your data, please review our <a href="https://reasstudio.github.io/roambuddy/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.
